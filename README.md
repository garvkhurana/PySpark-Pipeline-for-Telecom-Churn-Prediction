Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, where companies aim to retain their customers to sustain revenue and growth. This project leverages PySpark to build a scalable and efficient machine learning pipeline to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features such as usage patterns, customer demographics, and service-related information.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/garvkhurana/PySpark-Pipeline-for-Telecom-Churn-Prediction.git
cd telecom-churn-pyspark


Dataset
The telecom churn dataset contains information about customers, their usage patterns, and whether they have churned or not. The dataset can be found here.

Pipeline Steps
The PySpark pipeline consists of the following steps:

Data Ingestion:

Load the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical representations using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or String Indexing.
Normalize or scale numerical features.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might help improve model performance.
Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train machine learning models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression.
